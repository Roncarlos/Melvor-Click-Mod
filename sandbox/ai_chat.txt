Context:
I'm working on a mod for an idle game, that adds clicker mechanics to the game.
The current implementation consist of a button that you can click and that button increment a "counter" by a certain number of tick each time it's clicked.
I want to revamp this mechanic by changing the button to a mini-game that you can play to increment the counter.
The mini-game can be a little bit complex but should be simple enough to be played in a few seconds.
The mechanic should be fun and rewarding.
The mechanic should be balanced so that it's not too easy or too hard to increment the counter, we can imagine that the mini-game can also execute the action when the counter is incremented to max tick instead of just incrementing the counter by x tick.
Implementation:
Describe some ideas of mini-games that can be implemented for the mechanic "Woodcutting".
I want in the description of the mini-game to have the following information:
- The core mechanic of the mini-game
- The goal of the mini-game
- The secondary mechanics that can reward the player
